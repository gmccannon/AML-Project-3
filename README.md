Accuracy:    
CNN 12/12 test cases    
GBT 4/12 test cases    
SVM 8/12 test cases    
    
In each 28x28 image, each pixel (784), acts as a dimension.
Models that preform well in high dimensions will do better, explaning CNN > SVM > GBT  
    
When testing an image:   
The digit and background should be contrasting colors  
Try to make the image as square as possbile  
The digit should be centered, taking up about 80% the height of the image whole
